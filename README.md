# Features

## Totally local. Maximum security.
We don't collect any data about you - you don't even need to log in to use Foxlmind - and your posts are stored locally (on your computer).   
Don't trust us? Check our source, right here on GitHub.   

## Notes & to-dos. In one app.
It's easy to remember anything with Foxlmind - whether it's in need of an in-depth explanation or simple steps.   

## Themes? No problem.
With dark, light and easy-to-make custom themes with our Themes Designer, Foxlmind can look any way you want it to.   

## Simple design
Foxlmind has a simple design, which still proves to be great-looking (especially after Joasss' redesign in 0.7) and efficient.   

## Completion doesn't mean deletion.
You can view your completed posts in the Completed page, choose to mark them as uncompleted or permenantly delete them.   

## Quick & easy editing
Made a typo or have new ideas? Edit your post - change the date, title, content, and even add a to-do point to an existing post.
